# Opel_CAN_TID
Arduino Nano Project to receive and send can-bus messages at the mid-speed of a Opel Corsa D to implement a water temperature gauge in the TID (tiple information display). After a radio swap, the TID only show the current date. Thatâ€™s why I decided to retrofit a coolant temperature display, because GM hat decided to reduce the productions costs and eliminated this in the instrument display.


Milestones

	  Analysing CAN-Messages
	  
	  Verify that TID, GID and CID communication use similar protocol
	  
	  Send a constant message via CAN to Display
	  
	  Request temperature via CAN
	  
	  Send dynamic messages to Display
